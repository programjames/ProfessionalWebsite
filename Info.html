I'm James Camacho, a freshman at Timpview High School and an avid programmer! I have been programming for over seven years, and know several languages, though I primarily code in Python. I can do HTML, Javascript, and CSS, and also know a little bit of Java and C++ (though don't expect me to make anything complex with these!)
<br>
<br>
Using Python, I competed in <a href="https://www.battlecode.org/">MIT's Battlecode competition</a> in the 2018 season. In Battlecode, teams of up to four compete to build the best AI for a real-time strategy game the developers create each year. My team, consisting of myself and my twin brother, placed in the top 16 in the first tournament.
<br>
<br>
I have also competed in many math competitions, foremost among those is <a href="https://www.mathcounts.org/">MATHCOUNTS</a>. This is a middle school math competition with school, chapter, state and national rounds. I placed second in state in my 6th and 7th grade years, and won state in 8th grade, and ended up placing 30th at the national level.
<br>
<br>
In 7th and 8th grades, I also took the AMC 8 in the fall, scoring a perfect 25/25 both years. Later on in the winter, I challenged myself at the AMC 10, and both years I made it past the initial competition to the AIME. I scored a 7/15 both years on the AIME.
