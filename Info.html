I'm James Camacho, a freshman and programmer! I have been programming for over seven years, and know several languages, though I primarily code in Python. I can do HTML, Javascript, and CSS, and also know a little bit of Java and C++ (though don't expect me to make anything complex with these!)
<br>
<br>
Using Python, I competed in <a href="https://www.battlecode.org/">MIT's Battlecode competition</a> in the 2018 season. In Battlecode, teams of up to four compete to build the best AI for a real-time strategy game the developers create each year.
