	Hi, my name is James Camacho. I am currently a freshman in high school, and have been programming for over seven years now. I mainly use Python, but can do a little with C++, Java, and the web design group: HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

	This last year, I competed in MIT's Battlecode competition. In this competition, you create an AI for a real-time strategy game. Each year a new game is developed, so every competition season forces competitors to come up with a new strategy. My team, Double J (consisting of myself and a classmate), came in the top 16th in the Sprint Tournament, the first tournament in the competition.
